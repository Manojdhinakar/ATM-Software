# ATM-Software
- In this program , we have an ATM class with methods to display the balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. The Accountdisplay class represents the main application, where an instance of the ATM class is created, and the user interacts with the ATM through a simple text-based menu in a loop. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
- The concept used in the provided Java code is primarily Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects (instances of classes) to design and organize code. In the code, you can see the use of classes (ATM and Accountdisplay), objects (creating an instance of the ATM class), encapsulation (private fields and public methods), and abstraction (representing an ATM with methods like displayBalance, deposit, and withdraw). Additionally, the code uses a loop (while loop) for the menu-driven interaction, which demonstrates the use of looping constructs.
